Create a disk image with DMSREADER. You'll need 2 blank disks or 2 D64
files to write to. Multiple files with the extension .DMS will be created.

Recreate the original disk by using DMSWRITER.

The source code here is a mess and won't compile but I'm currently working on the assembly part of it with ACME assembler, and using Vice petcat to tokenise the BASIC programmes.
